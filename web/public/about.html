    <title>Kayak Cincinnati: About Us</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Here at Kayak Cincinnati, we strive to create a family friendly
      environment that encourages the exploration and appreciation of the
      Little Miami River through outdoor adventure. Our love for this
      beautiful river is expressed through our annual river clean up and our
      ongoing support of Little Miami Inc. and their preservation,
      conservation and education efforts concerning the Little Miami River
      water shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoy the Little Miami River as you paddle through some of the most
      beautiful, natural surroundings in the region. With it&rsquo;s
      designation as a State and National Scenic River this section of the
      Little Miami looks much the way it did 200 years ago with rolling,
      majestic banks, pristine waters and natural vegetation.
